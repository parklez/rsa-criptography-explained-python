# rsa-criptography-explained-python
An attempt to explain RSA cryptography step-by-step using Python.

I decided to write a script in pure python to help myself learn how RSA works in a simplified manner since I'm not in the fields of pure mathematics. If you're also a student in the fields of cyber security, this might help you.

# How to study
- If you don't have Python 3 installed, go ahead and download it OR find some online code runner. 
- Then open the code in your favorite text editor and read it from top to bottom.
- Use Python's IDLE to run the code (or use a terminal: `python3 rsa_step_by_step.py`)

There's a version with Brazilian Portuguese comments in this repository called `entendendo_criptografia.py`.
